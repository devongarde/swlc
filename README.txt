This program checks static web sites at source for broken links. It is relatively fast.

swlc -h
for a usage summary.

Please browse https://dylanharris.org/swlc for additional information,
including usage instructions, build instructions, issues, project goals,
and download opportunities.

Before building swlc, build and install:
- boost (https://boost.org/): I used 1.70, but older versions should be fine;
- Alexander Borisovâ€™s myhtml, version 4.0.5 (https://github.com/lexborisov/myhtml/).

Apologies that the makefile is primitive.
